# Application-of-Data-Mining-on-car-brands-using-twitter

In this project tweets were collected on car brands from the twitter API and cleaned to perform the sentiment analysis. This was done using two approaches and after which NaÃ¯ve Bayes and decision tree classification algorithms were applied to find the sentiment of the tweet. Finally, the car brands were ranked based on the number of positive and negative tweets that resulted from executing the above-mentioned method.

Description of the files:
--> Twitter_data_retrieval.py File is used to get the tweets from Twitter API.\n
--> Tweet_processing.py file is used for cleaning the tweets and applying Naive Bayes technique on the tweets obtained from twitter_data_retrieval.py file.\n
--> Application of Data Mining on Car Brands Using Twitter(dream_team).docx file is a document that contain complete details of the project.\n
--> carbrands_final.arff file contains the values of the fields that are extracted from tweets. We can apply several algorithms on by passing this file in WEKA tool.\n
